    <span class="subject">Algorithms, Games</span>
  </div>

  <p>Games for the Atari 2600 were quite constrained. When Warren Robinett first pitched the idea that would become <cite>Adventure</cite>, a game where you would explore a world with many rooms and pick up items to help you along the way, he was denied because it wasn't thought feasible. And it made sense to do so. This was the late 70s; there had never been a game with multiple screens before. This was in the days of <cite>Space Invaders</cite> and <cite>Pac Man</cite>, when everything in a game was in front of the player at all times, so the fact that <cite>Adventure</cite> was able to have 30 rooms when it was finally released in 1980 was quite impressive.</p>

  <p>It was quite an innovation to have multiple rooms, and the fact that <cite>Adventure</cite> managed to have 30 was revolutionary. But <cite>Pitfall!</cite>, made by David Crane and released in 1983, had 255, all of which were much more elaborate (graphically speaking) than anything in <cite>Adventure</cite>. In this article we'll talk about how this was done.</p>

    <span class="subject">Logic</span>
  </div>

  <p>If you've ever taken a class on logic you will have learned about contrapositives. A constrapositive of a statement <em>A implies B</em> is <em>not B implies not A</em>. So, for example, if you have the statement "the presence of rain implies the presence of clouds", the contrapositive of that would be "the absence of clouds implies the absence of rain". What's important about contrapositives is that they're logically equivalent to the original statement. That is, they mean the exact same thing.</p>

  <p>The title you see above is commonly cited as the contrapositive of the popular saying "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger". But it doesn't seem equivalent, and I'm here to argue that it's not.</p>

  <p>In the <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org">Nand to Tetris</a> course you have to do many things. It's quite a fun course. In project 8 you implement a compiler from VM code into assembly code. Most of the compiler is straightforward, but there's one part that requires a clever trick, one sufficiently interesting to make me want to write about it.</p>

  <p>Often times before bed I like to play my Gameboy. Not my Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Color, but my good ol' fashioned DMG. What's nice about it is that the lack of a backlit display makes it easy on the eyes at night, so it doesn't hinder your sleep like a phone or computer would.</p>

    <span class="subject">Web Design</span>
  </div>

  <p>I have a guilty pleasure of visiting websites of professors. Their, um... minimal design brings me back to when I first went online in the early 2000s. Their aesthetic, or lack thereof, inspires nostalgia, but at the same time, is, well, really bad. Text going to the edge of the screen, Times New Roman, microscopic line height, pure blue links... it's a sight to behold. But because of this the sites have instantaneous loading times, and free up the professor to make some amazing content.</p>

    <span class="subject">Logic, Computers</span>
  </div>

  <p><cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> brands itself as a book that “explores the gap between theoretical ideas and pragmatic instructions,” but never ends up doing anything at all. After 196 pages all I came away with was a few examples of software (the author, Ed Finn, seems to think algorithms and software are the same thing) not behaving exactly as we'd like because of the messy nature of the real world.</p>

  <p>There's been an equation on my mind lately, that goes something like this:</p>

  <p class="center"><em>information</em> = <em>data</em> + <em>interpretation</em></p>

  <p>It's a pretty simple idea, but it's one that has helped me organize my thoughts on many occasions and sort through complicated topics more easily. This isn't going to be a very focused article, but rather a collection of ideas that have crossed my mind lately, which I'll attempt to use in order to show the usefulness of the above equation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the final gym in Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire there is a puzzle you have to solve before being able to challenge Wallace. It is arranged like so:</p>

  <img src="./posts/images/RS_Sootopolis_Gym.png" alt="Sootopolis City Gym">

  <p>To solve it, you have to step on each block of ice exactly once in each of the three sections. Not only that, but the final block you stepped on in each section had to be the one situated before the ice slide. Once all the squares were stepped on in a section the ice slide would turn into stairs, allowing you access to the next section of the puzzle, and finally Gym Leader Wallace.</p>

  <p>In this article we'll come up with a way to program to solve this puzzle, and all puzzles like it, with about 60 lines of JavaScript.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It has been assumed, by mathematicians and laymen alike, that if something were true it could be proven. In 1931 Kurt Gödel showed this assumption to be mistaken. Gödel first published this result in a short paper titled “On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems” as a response to questions that had arose about uncertainties in the foundations of mathematics. Gödel showed that such uncertainties in mathematics are inexorable and in so doing forever changed perceptions of mathematics, reasoning, and philosophy.</p>

  <p>This is a discussion about forming gradients through color spaces, a gradient being a smooth transition between two colors. RGB and HSL will be the focus, but much will be able to be extrapolated to other spaces. In part 1 we define the RGB and HSL color space. In part 2 we discuss what a gradient is and how to define it mathematically. In part 3, as a bit of fun, we will define an alternative way of forming gradients in HSL space.</p>

  <p>My sister would always tell me that I was wasting my time by looking into the sky, but I saw more in it than I saw anywhere on Earth. Today the moon was hung above the sun, placed by God, I would have to assume, as a sign meaning something very important, and I was looking very intently at it, as, you see, my sister was not around to intrude on my proclivities. I sat against the rock wall before my home; my mother would, time and again, yell at my sister and me for running along its top, but, you see, she was not here today either...</p>

    <span class="title"><a href="posts/definitions.html">.999... and How Mathematics Works</a></span>
    <span class="subject">Math</span>
  </div>

  <p>The first thing that needs to be said is that mathematical objects aren't real. At least, they're not real like you and I. Mathematical truths and objects “exist” entirely due to definitions and the logic that ties them together. The reason why .999... is equal to one is entirely due to the way we define what it means for a decimal to repeat.</p>

    <span class="title"><a href="posts/fibonacci.html">Time Complexity of Recursive Fibonacci</a></span>
    <span class="subject">Algorithms, Math</span>
  </div>

  <p>The algorithm (given in C) for the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> fibonacci number is this:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> n) {
  <span class="keyword">if</span> (n == 1 || n == 2) <span class="keyword">return</span> 1;
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(n - 1) + <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(n - 2);
}
</pre>
  <p>It's simple enough, but the runtime complexity isn't entirely obvious. An initial assumption might be that it is O(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>), as it is a recursive formula that branches twice each call, but this isn't the best upper-bound.</p>

    <span class="subject">Music</span>
  </div>

  <p>Bach's cello suites are a towering accomplishment of baroque music. Taking a single, ostensibly monophonic instrument and utilizing all of its abilities and intracacies Bach created some of the most iconic music of all time. Enjoying thousands of recordings since they were first recorded in the thirties by Pablo Casals, from the terribly over-rated (Yo-Yo Ma) to the terribly underrated (Thomas Demenga), these pieces of music have inspired for centuries, yet they have been lacking one thing: a clickbait ranking.</p>

  <p>The sun shone more brightly than usual when Vasily Ilyanovich took his first steps, as did the eyes and smile of his
  mother. Dinara was twenty one years old, and the sight of her firstborn on the journey in which he would become a man
  like his late father brought her a joy only enriched by the recollection of her deceased husband. She sat on a rocking
  chair in a small room, which apart from that chair contained only a small bed and small crib, a world unto itself
  provided entirely by Count Andrei Nikolaevich Khilkov, a man whose extraordinary wealth was exceeded only by his natural
  affection for all men (though especially women)...</p>

    <span class="subject">Literature</span>
  </div>

  <p>Reading Moby Dick you (or at least I) get the impression of three quite distinct sub-books. Why this might be is an open question, but Melville certainly went into this endeavor not knowing what exactly it was he planned on writing, so when he starts he does so with a cookie-cutter (for the time), mediocre sea yarn about a character named Ishmael, his meeting of a savage, and their eventual hire on a whaling vessel. This sub-book is fine enough if you're into that sort of thing, but it didn't do much for me, and it's not why Moby Dick is remembered as it is.</p>
