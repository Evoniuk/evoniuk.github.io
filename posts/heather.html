  <h2>Heather | A Short Story</h2>

  <p>My sister would always tell me that I was wasting my time by looking into the sky, but I saw more in it than I saw anywhere on Earth. Today the moon was hung above the sun, placed by God, I would have to assume, as a sign meaning something very important, and I was looking very intently at it, as, you see, my sister was not around to intrude on my proclivities. I sat against the rock wall before my home; my mother would, time and again, yell at my sister and me for running along its top, but, you see, she was not here today either. Considering this, I knew I hadn’t occasion to worry about taking a break from my ruminations upon the firmament to quickly run along the rocks. I believe the rocks were first placed here by my father, who also liked to look into the sky. I remember last week he was feeling quite sick; I asked him again and again to come and tell me about the constellations, the titans that strode across the heavens just as I strode across the rock wall, but he discourteously declined, saying he wasn’t able, but that as soon as he felt better he would be sure to fill my mind with every star there was. I was so excited then.</p>

  <p>I looked to my left and saw the dead grass. Most of our grass had dried up in the summer heat, just as many other things. Last time I went to get water from the town’s well I pulled up an empty pail. This, however, was more due to the well falling into disrepair than the heat, you see, but it stopped me from being able to bring water back home all the same. So it goes. I don’t mind suffering myself, so going without water wasn’t so bad, I just don’t like seeing others go through it. Though, if you think about it, if other people suffering brings me pain, then that is what suffering is to me, which I said I didn’t mind, so perhaps I’m wrong. Maybe I don’t like suffering. Maybe I hate it. I looked back at the moon and lost the will to consider my own suffering, as surely the moon, with all its spots and holes, all its craters and scars, has endured far more than I ever have or ever could. How lonely it must be up there. And cold. I know I couldn’t be the moon, so I’m grateful that the moon took it upon itself to be what it is.</p>

  <p>A shadow passes across my view, its beak in the direction of my door.  I think the shadows started coming over last week, typically to talk with my parents. I always liked when they came over, as they smelled of refreshing heather, and looked like crows with white faces, but with the bodies of men. Their muffled voices sounded funny to me.</p>

  <p>I was starting to get hot sitting still in the sun, so I decided to go see my friend. I walked across the heath, stepping on sticks and cracking grass. I saw the many homes that had recently become houses, among them the dwelling of my friend. I knocked on her door and she was the only one to answer. Her parents had left a few days ago. While I have curly, flaxen hair, my friend has wavy red, and she is very proud of this. Her family had been the only ones in the town that had had such hair, and it was always a sight to see them all walking together. She and I decided to climb our favorite tree.</p>

  <p>I went right up to its trunk and looked straight up, to get the most impressive view of what I was soon to conquer. It had become less impressive since it dried up with everything else, but its height still impressed all the same. Quickly I jumped up and grabbed the lowest branch, which had felt my grasp countless times before, always followed by the pressure of my feet, first the left, then the right. But not this time. I tried again. I tried again. I knew my prior climb would have to stand as my last. I tried again…</p>

  <p>I stop trying. My friend tries, and she nearly makes it too, but can’t muster it. She isn’t like me; this is her only attempt, and she starts crying. She starts sobbing. I can’t bear the suffering of others. I suffer it with them. I cry with her. I sob with her. It’s the plainness of the reality before us that brings our counterfeit world to an end. She and I sit against our favorite tree, the tree that had, in life, brought us so much joy, and now, in death, is here for our despair. I hold my friend and she holds me. We look down at our bony hands clasped together, tighter and tighter, a tension rising with the tenor of our cries, unable to look above, where the moon looms over the sun. I muster the strength to look in her eyes, but in them lose that strength. We collapse into each other as our hearts collapse inside of us. It took us so long. We did so well. But now, seeing each other’s fear and resignation manifest in her countenance, it’s finally too much to bear. I feel her bones against mine. Her shoulder juts against my arm, but I haven’t much feeling left anyway…</p>

  <p>It comes time to stop. We get up and walk back to my house, picking heather along the way. It’s the only thing that hasn’t dried up. Hasn’t died. We get back just in time. The shadows, the doctors, are with my father, and my mother, and my sister, going with them as they leave the house. There goes my father. I look up, but see no stars. The sun is too bright. Then my mother. I hear her worried voice ordering me off the wall. Then my sister. I put my hands on the rocks we climbed as I see her hair, which was just like mine, poking out of the cloth that conceals the rest of her. My friend hands me the heather she picked, and I give it all to the last doctor. He looks at me and thanks me without gratitude, telling each of us to find him when the time comes for the other. His muffled voice is no longer funny. My friend is more affected that I am. I don’t know which of us will have to go with the doctor first. I hope I do. I can’t bear her suffering, and I’m so tired. She takes my hand and squeezes it, both of us so so afraid of letting go, both of us so so aware that we’ll have to, so so soon. We sit against the rock wall and fall against each other, and look into the sky, where I see more than I will ever see on the Earth. The moon hasn’t moved at all.</p>
