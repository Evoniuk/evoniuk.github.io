  <h1>Don't Trust Everything You Read Online</h1>

  <p>Often times before bed I like to play my Gameboy. Not my Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Color, but my good ol' fashioned DMG. What's nice about it is that the lack of a backlit display makes it easy on the eyes at night, so it doesn't hinder your sleep like a phone or computer would.</p>

  <p>Well, one night I was playing one of my favorite games for the Gameboy, <cite>Choplifter II</cite>. Games on the Gameboy couldn't save data (unless the cartridge itself had an internal battery; this was the case for Zelda and Pokemon Games, among others), so they often relied on passwords that you could write down and then use to resume progress at a certain point. This is the system Choplifter uses.</p>

  <p>After many tries I finally beat Sector 2, level 3, at which point I was provided a password which would allow me to access the next stage, Sector 3, level 1. This was late at night and my cat was sleeping on top of me, so I was morally obligated not to disturb her. I figured I would just look up the code in the morning and all would be right. When I woke up, all was not right.</p>

  <p>If you google "choplifter 2 passwords" the first link (as of writing this) brings you to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/585666-choplifter-ii/cheats" target="blank">a gamefaqs page</a>, where the password for level 3-1 is listed as 'GDGMPTY'. If you go to your copy of Chopliter II (which I assume you must have) and type this in however, nothing will happen. This is because GDGMPTY is not the correct code.</p>

  <p>Very well, we'll go to the second link that appears when you google Choplifter II passwords. That brings you to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/choplifter-ii/cheats/" target="blank">a gamespot page</a> where the same password is listed. If you scroll to the footers of these two sites, you'll see that they're actually both managed by Gamespot, so it makes sense that the same information would be provided by both.</p>

  <p>So, you might think you can try the third link on google. It goes to <a href="https://www.chaptercheats.com/cheats/gameboy/20216/Choplifter-2-Cheats.htm" target="blank">a chaptercheats page</a>, which is not managed by gamespot, and yet it still gives the same incorrect password for level 3-1. What's going on here?</p>

  <p>If you look at the two pages managed by Gamespot, you'll see the information was posted there by "LandOfGameCubes". If you go to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/LandOfGameCubes/contributions/cheats" target="blank">the profile page of this user</a>, it says the Choplifter II codes were submitted in February of 2002. On the chaptercheats site, it lists the incorrect code as provided by user amyveras in October of 2006, so we can assume she got the incorrect code from LandOfGameCubes.</p>

  <p>Now, the correct code is 'GDGMPLY', which you can get from any of the other sites that show up in the google search or actually beating level 2-3, which I eventually did again. But let this be a cautionary tale. You can never assume that information you find, even from three different sources, is correct. Here, we saw an error from 2002 spreading to three sites over four years. The only date I could find for the correct password coming online was from October of 2004, from <a href="https://www.cheathappens.com/10014-Game_Boy-Choplifter_2_cheats">cheathappens</a>. So right between LandOfGameCubes and amyveras posting the incorrect password, the correct password was uploaded, but alas, it did not reach everyone in time.</p>

  <p>Now, is there a point to me investigating the history and timeline of Choplifter II passwords online? No. But it was kinda fun.</p>
