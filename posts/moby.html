  <h1>Thoughts on Moby Dick</h1>

  <h2>Moby Dick is Actually Three Books</h2>

  <p>Reading Moby Dick you (or at least I) get the impression of three quite distinct sub-books.</p>

  <p>Why this might be is an open question, but Melville certainly went into this endeavor not knowing what exactly it was he planned on writing, so when he starts he does so with a cookie-cutter (for the time), mediocre sea yarn about a character named Ishmael, his meeting of a savage, and their eventual hire on a whaling vessel. This sub-book is fine enough if you're into that sort of thing, but it didn't do much for me, and it's not why Moby Dick is remembered as it is.</p>

  <p>The next sub-book is a one for which no one asked and is the reason this book should never be assigned in high school. It's
    a nonfiction book about the whaling industry in the 1800s. This book is so astonishingly boring that it beggars
    belief. Everyone has at one time or another caught themselves at the end of a paragraph and realized they just moved their eyes over it without reading, but never before have I had that happen for pages at a time. Here is one of many gems that
    Melville grants his lucky readers:</p>

  <blockquote>
    It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts
    are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in
    him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged
    with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the
    spout — whether it be water or whether it be vapour — no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it
    is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories.
  </blockquote>

  <aside><cite>The Fountain</cite></aside>

  <p>It is amazing how that ended up in a novel. In another chapter Melville starts by claiming that</p>

  <blockquote>
    The allusion to the waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of
    the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
  </blockquote>
  <aside><cite>Fast Fish and Loose Fish</cite></aside>

  <p>I disagree, as I imagine most readers would, but he nevertheless he goes on to educate his reader on this most important of topics:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the
    States-General in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American
    fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
    comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of
    Meddling with other People's Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a
    harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.
  </blockquote>

  <p>At this point I'm indulging myself by throwing in quotes that annoy me, but allow me one more, as this one is comically bad:</p>

  <blockquote>
    But the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
  </blockquote>
  <aside><cite>The Affadavit</cite></aside>

  <p>This passage reminds me of my English papers in high school in which I would try to find the most verbose possible way to say nothing at all in order to get to the required word count. All Melville was trying to get across in the above passage was that the reader might not know some things, so he intends to tell you, which isn't something that even needs saying; we, as readers, are reading because we know Melville has something to say. He doesn't need to convince us that he should be writing what we are already reading.</p>

  <!-- <hr> -->

  <p>But then, at the end, a third sub-book emerges from the depths, so to speak. The third book is about Captain Ahab, and is incredible. It has a depth and tragedy and majesty and power so effective that it deserves to be read by everyone who is serious about literature. It is phenomenal.</p>

  <p>As a small demonstration of Melville's power as a writer in this third book, here is a passage in which Captain Ahab is talking to Starbuck, the first mate, after Starbuck implores him to abandon his reckless quest for vengeance against an animal.</p>

  <blockquote>
    What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel,
    remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and
    jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so
    much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is
    an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart
    beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not
    I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike.
  </blockquote>

  <p>He then then turns to Starbuck. Tragically, however,</p>

  <blockquote>
    blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Such effective and affective writing is hard to come by, and the last third of Moby Dick is full of it. I often had to put the book down after reading certain passages in order to absorb what it was I had just read. This third book is why Moby Dick is remembered, and why it deserves to be so. It's just a shame Melville took two other books to get to it.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Melville truly did accomplish something with Moby Dick, but it is marred through and through with blatant flaws. In one
    chapter, <cite>The Cabin</cite>, Melville even forgets that he's writing from Ishmael's perspective, and describes a
    conversation to which Ishmael obviously would not have access. And in the last third or so of the novel Ishmael is
    essentially absent from the story entirely; only in the epilogue does Melville remember he was writing this book in the
    first person.</p>

  <p>This kind of obvious and technical flaw is especially harmful when you consider that this book is so often assigned to
    high schoolers, most of whom have no awareness of the amazing world of literature. When they start reading they might
    put up with the sea yarn, but the copious nonfiction will make this book such a chore that before the worthwhile reading
    comes they've already given up, just using spark notes to get the assignments done.</p>

  <p>Not only this, but there are some genuinely weird and almost disconcerting sections:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed
    that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands
    in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this
    avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally [...] Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us
    squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
  </blockquote>
  <aside><cite>A Squeeze of the Hand</cite></aside>

  <p>And when this is a book that is regarded as highly as it is, and is given to them as an example of quality literature,
    they only end up taking away from the experience that literature is stodgy and boring and weird and, worst of all, not for them.
    They will never see the incredible and tragic human drama at the end for which this book is justly praised and which anyone
    would enjoy, and instead think mediocre and weird stories about savages and nonfiction about whaling is what their
    teachers think make great literature. It's a crime to assign this book to people who are not already invested in
    literature.</p>

    <hr>

  <p>Ultimately, all I'd say is that you really do need to read this book, but that when you do, get an abridged version.</p>
