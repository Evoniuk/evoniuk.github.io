    <h1>Time Complexity of Recursive Fibonacci</h1>

    <p>The algorithm (given in C) for the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> fibonacci number is this:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> n) {
  <span class="keyword">if</span> (n == 1 || n == 2) <span class="keyword">return</span> 1;
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(n - 1) + <span class="function">fibonacci</span>(n - 2);
}</code></pre>

    <p>It's simple enough, but the runtime complexity isn't entirely obvious. An initial assumption might be that it is O(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>), as it is a recursive formula that branches twice each call, but this isn't the best upper-bound.</p>

    <p>The reason for this is that the branch of the recursive call calculating <code>fibonacci(n - 2)</code> will terminate faster than the one calculating <code>fibonacci(n - 1)</code>, this fact being compounded on each call, so there's one path that will get to a base case in <em>n</em> / 2 calls, and another getting there in <em>n</em> calls, with all sorts of other paths in between.</p>

    <p>The key to getting the proper complexity of fibonacci, then, is to count how many times base cases are reached, as we know that if there are, say, <em>n</em> base cases reached, then there couldn't be more than 2<em>n</em> total functions calls*, and O(2<em>n</em>) = O(<em>n</em>).</p>
    <aside>* If in doubt, try drawing out the tree and convincing yourself.</aside>

    <p>Finding the number of base cases reached is actually quite easy; it's <code>fibonacci(n)</code>! <code>fibonacci(n)</code> is equal to the sum of all base cases, as each base case returns 1. Thus, if we find an explicit formula for the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> fibonacci number, we can find the complexity of <code>fibonacci</code>.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, an explicit formula has already been derived, courtesy of the brilliant French-British mathematician Abraham de Moivre. He discovered, among many other things, that</p>

    <aside>Despite being originally discovered by De Moivre, this formula is called Binet's Formula, after French mathematician Jacques Binet.</aside>

    <p>Where <em>F<sub>n</sub></em> is the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> fibonacci number.</p>

    <p>The first term in Binet's Formula is also known as the golden ratio, typically denoted with the greek letter ϕ.</p>

    <p>Thus, the complexity of <code>fibonacci</code> is O(<em>F<sub>n</sub></em>) = O(ϕ<em><sup>n</sup></em>). This is approximately O(1.618<sup><em>n</em></sup>). Still awful, but a little better than the initial assumption of O(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>).</p>
