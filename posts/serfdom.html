  <h2>Serfdom | A Short Story</h2>

  <p>The sun shone more brightly than usual when Vasily Ilyanovich took his first steps, as did the eyes and smile of his
    mother. Dinara was twenty one years old, and the sight of her firstborn on the journey in which he would become a man
    like his late father brought her a joy only enriched by the recollection of her deceased husband. She sat on a rocking
    chair in a small room, which apart from that chair contained only a small bed and small crib, a world unto itself
    provided entirely by Count Andrei Nikolaevich Khilkov, a man whose extraordinary wealth was exceeded only by his natural
    affection for all men (though especially women). Like many Russian nobility in 1853, Khilkov was deeply conflicted about
    his ownership of serfs, and so when Dinara’s husband (one such serf) fell to his death during the maintenance of
    Khilkov’s estate a month before the birth of his son, the Count, while genuinely affected by the tragedy, was also
    genuinely grateful for the opportunity to ease his confused conscience with the provision of housing for his late
    worker’s widow in his estate.</p>

  <p>‘Vasya! Keep going!’ Dinara’s world, which is to say her room, was larger than what everybody else called the world at
    that moment. When Vasily rounded the corner of the bed such that his mother could no longer see him, she jumped from her
    chair onto the bed and laid on her stomach with her head hovering above her son, the ecstatic look on her face
    attracting him to her. Little Vasily reached his arms up to his mother, and upon doing so lost his balance and fell on
    the floor, causing both he and his mother to laugh. She picked him up, rotating over to lay on her back, and held him up
    above her for a moment before setting him down on her stomach. ‘Soon you’ll be walking and running and I won’t be able
    to catch up to you!’ Caught off guard by what she herself had just said, Dinara burst into tears. Soon she won’t be able
    to catch her son. Soon her entire world will have a will of its own, and even make mistakes. Soon this fragile little
    child won’t have her help, just as he already lacked the help of his father, and what’s worse, won’t even need it…</p>

  <p>Count Khilkov was pacing the halls of his enormous estate, entertaining a fantasy of showing the Emperor himself around
    when he heard crying coming from the room to his left. Recognizing this room as that of Dinara, whom he preferred even
    to his wife despite not being aware of it, he rushed in to provide the comfort he so enjoyed giving. When he entered he
    saw dust illuminated by the sun hovering above a chair that was rocking despite being unoccupied, and on the bed the
    crying mother with her son. ‘What’s wrong Dinara?’ he asked softly, and sat down on the bed to her right, putting his
    hand on her shoulder and giving a slight squeeze. She answered by smiling and putting her hand on his, still crying
    profusely. Her head was still over the side of the bed and unsupported, and was growing tired, but enjoying and wishing
    to maintain the position of her benefactor she stayed in the position she was. They both stayed there for a minute while
    Dinara’s crying gave way to a more tempered melancholy, enjoying the closeness only a particular mix of sadness and
    happiness can provide.</p>

  <p>When Dinara’s head finally became too sore to ignore, and well after Khilkov started wondering how long she would
    maintain such a position, she sat upright and twisted around, putting her feet on the ground and her son in her lap.
    Tired from crying, and seeing that the Count was aware of her soreness, she laid her head on Khilkov’s shoulder. Both of
    them had a great deal of affection for the other, and on occasion wondered what another life would have allowed for
    them, yet were both content with the way things were, their contentedness supported by the knowledge that their stations
    afforded them no other possibilities. Aware of the impropriety, Dinara lifted her head a moment after placing it there.
    They looked at each other.</p>

  <p>‘My little Vasya took his first steps.’ Dinara explained, as if the Count still expected an answer to the question he
    forgot he had asked. ‘Oh! How wonderful!’ he said with some confusion, and then turned to the baby, ‘I’ll expect you to
    start working tomorrow then?’. He and Dinara shared a laugh, inspiring laughter in Vasily as well, before Khilkov got
    up, wished Dinara and Vasily well, placing his hands on each of their backs for a moment, and rejoined the imagined
    Emperor out in the hall.</p>

  <p>Alone with her son once more, Dinara surveyed her world. The rocking chair had become still and Vasily quiet, and she
    was brought memories of the first room the Count had given her. That room was several times the size of the one she
    currently occupied, had hardly anything made without gold, had two tables of different sizes, a mirror, a wardrobe, a
    bed with silk drapes and sheets and pillows, a lamp, a carpet, a silver and enamel samovar accompanied by a case for
    china, books that Dinara could not read on account of her illiteracy, and other such superfluous nonsense that, in her
    estimation, was an offense to her role in life. God made her a serf and so she was owed the life of one, nothing more.
    Khilkov pushing opulence onto her was akin to a lion giving a fine steak to a horse; she admired the room as fitting for
    a Count, as giving him life and helping him to be what he was, but to her it was indigestible, stifling rather than
    enriching her life and alienating her from herself. ‘Master this is too much for me, surely-’ she had started to say to
    the Count upon entering the room, before he interrupted her, ‘Dinara you are my guest and as such are entitled to the
    best I have to offer. And please don’t call me master, I am merely your host.’ He then moved around the room showing off
    the amenities, taking pleasure in introducing this poor serf to the luxury only he could (or would) offer her.</p>

  <p>‘Here you will find the samovar, and here the tea. The wardrobe will fit far more than you’d think’ - he stopped himself
    from saying ‘far more than you have’ - ‘so we’ll have to get you some more clothes. If you are ever bored feel free to
    browse the literature, the selection isn’t much, but it’s all quite good. Have you heard of Herzen? Hasn’t written a
    novel in so long but I so hope he will again, the man’s a genius. There isn’t a crib yet but we will have one brought in
    when the time comes, which I can tell is very soon!’ - he was looking at her comically large stomach.</p>

  <p>Khilkov continued along in this fashion for a while, frequently making asides Dinara didn’t understand yet could tell
    were amusing, and so amused her regardless, only stopping when a servant came in informing him of a guest, at which
    point he bade her farewell and to address any questions to either of his children, who were in rooms nearby. Alone, save
    for the child in her belly, she grew uncomfortable. This was too much for her. Everything was still and resisted being
    given life. When the Count was there everything was alive, everything was understood and had a purpose that could be
    governed, but now that it was only her everything died. It was the stillness in her current room that reminded her of
    all this, but she rejoiced in her ability to now give life to what she had. She had been given her current room when,
    the morning after her first night in the estate, she was found on the floor by a servant, it being the only place she
    could fall asleep.</p>
