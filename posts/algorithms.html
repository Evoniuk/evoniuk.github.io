  <h1><cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> is a Bad Book</h1>

  <p><cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> brands itself as a book that “explores the gap between theoretical ideas and pragmatic instructions,” but never ends up doing anything at all. After 196 pages all I came away with was a few examples of software (the author, Ed Finn, seems to think algorithms and software are the same thing) not behaving exactly as we'd like because of the messy nature of the real world.</p>

  <p>But apart from listing examples anyone in the modern world could come up with, Finn also found it necessary to saturate his work with philosophical nonsense and buzzwords that not only add nothing, but detract significantly from whatever point was trying to be made (if there ever was one).</p>

  <p>Consider the following examples, all taken from the first chapter:</p>

  <blockquote>The pragmatic definition lays bare the essential politics of the algorithm, its transparent complicity in the ideology of instrumental reason</blockquote>

  <blockquote>What are the truth claims underlying the engineer's problems and solutions, or the philosophy undergirding the technological magic of sorcery?</blockquote>

  <blockquote>this notion of the organism as message reframes biology (and the human) to exist at least aspirationally within the boundary of effective computability</blockquote>

  <blockquote>This fundamental alchemy, the mysterious fungibility of sorcery, reinforces a reading of the Turing machine as an ur-algorithm that has been churning out effective computability abstractions in the minds of its "users" for eighty years. The "thing" that software has become is the cultural figure of the algorithm: instantiated metaphors for effective procedures.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The algorithm is not a space where the material and symbolic orders are contested, but rather a magical or alchemical realm where they operate in productive indeterminacy.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>In this light, computation is a universal solvent precisely because it is both metaphor and machine.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The algorithm of the progress bar depends not only on the code generating it but the cultural calculus of waiting itself</blockquote>

  <blockquote>And the first tool, the ur-process, is the intersubjective culture machine of language.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>It is rooted in computer science but it serves as a prism for a much broader array of cultural, philosophical, mathematical, and imaginative grammars.</blockquote>

  <p>What in the world could any of that possibly mean? The needless scarequotes, pointless adjectives, and randomly calling things “magic” are themes that persist throughout this book and gradually erode any meaning it might have had.</p>

  <p>I've read many bad books (I even subjected myself to <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>), but this book poses a larger problem than just my annoyance. The topic that Finn attempts to address is indeed important: algorithms and software are taking over our lives faster than any other technology has, and that poses dangers and problems that require scrutiny. But if someone wishing to think more deeply about this topic went to this book I can only imagine they would become discouraged, thinking the topic to be overly complicated, when really it's only Finn's deliberately obfuscatory language that's complicated. This book just muddies the waters around a topic that is actually fairly straightforward, and only does a disservice to the discourse around it.</p>

  <p>The ostensible goal of <cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> still needs accomplishment, but must be done by someone willing to actually talk, in a straightforward way, about actual technical issues, instead of indulging in a need to seem smart.</p>
